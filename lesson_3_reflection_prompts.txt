When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Best to use a remote repository when collaborating with several people or when working on the same machine is not always possible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we probably don't always want changes comming in during an intermediate phase of our work and may change the files we are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

The difference between fork and clone is that forks are a GitHub functionality that works similar to cloning but with additional functionality; branching works on commits and not the entire repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

We can traverse history easily without the need of having to connect to the remote everytime we need access to the logs

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I would probably use another version control system like SVN or Mercurial. I don't think it would be easier or harder its just a matter of adjusting to a different workflow.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Everytime we are working in a new feature or defect we would want to work in a separate branch. Befenits to each approach is branching we can have different layers of a working environment vs in a master branch we don't have to worry about things like merge conflicts.
